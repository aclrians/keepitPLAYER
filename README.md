# keepitPLAYER
A music player that is  reliant on local files.

I want to stop paying so much for Spotify and I need to start building something 
of value.

I want to personalize the collection of music that I love and listen to.

Build the profiles of my favorite artists, adding sounds and animations that I 
find convenient.

I do not want discovery algos. I just want to organize and play music. 

Therefore, we have to keep it player.
